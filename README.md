## Gender_Inequality_and_HIV_AIDS_Africa

This repository has the objective of graphing data on Gender Disparities in Adolescent HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa over time, particularly for Eastern and Southern Africa. Adolescents between 10 and 19 years of age were analyzed. The data source is: [Gender Inequality in HIV Infections in Adolescents](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w2)

Two indicators were plotted.
 * Estimated number of annual AIDS related deaths
 * Estimated number of people living with HIV

Prior to 2013, women have a higher estimated number of annual AIDS related deaths than men. However, since 2013, it can be seen that both groups present similar figures, with a reduction in the number of deaths for both groups, after having reached a peak between 2007 and 2008. 

### 2\. **Estimated number of people living with HIV**

The graph suggests that the estimated number of people living with HIV has increased for both women and men. While women consistently present a higher number of cases over time, men present a higher growth rate in recent years.
